# Script to compile the Ampl Solver Library using cl/link. Why this approach?
# Well, we don't want to get into the business of creating (and maintaining)
# the full set of autotools source files for the ASL. This approach tries to
# leverage makefile.vc, which comes with ASL.

# To support VPATH builds, the strategy is to copy the sources to the build
# directory, build, and then erase the sources when we're done. Start by
# copying the sources.

# Adjust solvers/makefile.vc for the situation at hand. When building with cl
# under cygwin, we can't execute comptry.bat. The sole purpose of comptry.bat
# is to retry the compile with -DNO_LONG_LONG in an environment where long long
# does not exist. Since we've already tested for long long in configure and set
# ASLMAKEFLAGS accordingly, we can discard comptry.bat without worry.

# Do the build. CFLAGS specified on the command line (as a result of autoconf
# replacing ASLMAKEFLAGS) will override the specs in makefile.vc, ensuring that
# ASL is built with the same compiler flags as other code. Makefile.vc also
# forces CC=cl, but since Coin only uses makefile.vc for the cl compiler,
# there's no need to override it here.

# It turns out that Gnu make always sets MAKEFLAGS to --unix, and nmake tries
# to process this, resulting in error U1065. Clear MAKEFLAGS to fix the
# problem.
